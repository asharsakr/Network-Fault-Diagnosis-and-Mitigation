This project focuses on designing and implementing a small campus network using Huawei eNSP and perform Network-Fault-Diagnosis-and-Mitigation system upon it. The design consists of four Autonomous Systems (AS100, AS200, AS300, AS400). Each AS contains end-user devices, access switches, aggregation switches, core switches, a firewall, and an edge router. 
The goal was to build a scalable, secure, and well structured network that supports departmental segmentation through VLANs and dynamic routing through OSPF.
